####Introduction

>The http. Dir of go will make a system call every time it is read. Even if the file is not modified, this can be optimized.

>This package provides HttpCacheFs. You can replace http. Dir (path) with cachefs. HttpCacheFs (path). The read file is not modified (currently judged by comparing the modification time), which can avoid system calls and improve performance.
